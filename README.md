# Overview

As a software engineer aiming to strengthen my programming skills in various languages. Through this project, I seek to reinforce my understanding of fundamental programming concepts in Kotlin which will hopefully make me more interested in building more using this language.

The software consists of a command-line interface where users can choose from various options, including logging in, changing passwords, generating random passwords, and adding new credentials.

There are two purposes in creating this software. I wish to master the basic programming concepts by implementing real-world functionality in Kotlin. And also, I intend to enhance my understanding of data management in this language. Through this project, I strive to build confidence in my abilities to apply fundamentals of programming.
